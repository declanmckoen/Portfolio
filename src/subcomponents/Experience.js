            <h3><i className="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass"></i> Insightful Analysis Solutions</h3>
            <p>My title at Insightful Analysis Solutions (IAS) was research assistant, but my duties extended far beyond plain research. Aside from the literature analyses I performed for grant proposals, I also participated in the structure and design of the internal operations. Given that IAS was a blossoming company, I was involved in website design, tool collection, and budget analysis.</p>

            <p>My time at KidzHack was my first introduction to the realm of industry-based software engineering. I was in charge of backend production of their website, which involved maintaining an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Dynamodb database as well as optmiizing tasks using AWS Lambda.</p>
            <p>The project that I was working on will benefit thousands of middle school students when the work is finally complete. Our website will monitor students' mental health and send alerts to teachers if a student exhibits warning signs.</p>
